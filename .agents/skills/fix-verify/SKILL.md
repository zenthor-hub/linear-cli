# Fix Verification

Resolve issues reported by this project's verification commands.

## Workflow

1. Pick the right entrypoint:
   - If the user reports a specific failing command, run that command first.
   - If the scope is unclear, run `bun run verify` from the repo root.
2. Categorize failures by:
   - `oxlint`
   - TypeScript
   - `oxfmt`
   - unit tests
   - live CLI smoke checks, if the user requested them
3. Prefer root-cause fixes over suppressions.
4. Use automatic fixes where appropriate:
   - `bun run oxlint:fix`
   - `bun run oxfmt:fix`
5. Prefer targeted fixes over broad rewrites.
6. Apply targeted manual fixes for anything remaining.
7. Re-run the same verification command that failed first.
8. Before finishing, run the broadest relevant final check, usually `bun run verify`.
9. Stop only when the relevant verification passes or there is a clear blocker.

## Rules

- Never silence errors with `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-expect-error`, `as any`, or unjustified non-null assertions.
- Maintain behavior while fixing analysis issues.
- Do not run Linear mutations with `--apply` unless the user explicitly asked for a mutation.
- Use `--json` for CLI smoke checks that need parsing.
- Report any remaining non-fixable issue clearly, with file path and reason.

## Output

Use this summary shape:

```text
Verification Fix Results:
- Initial issues found: X oxlint, Y typecheck, Z oxfmt, W tests
- Auto-fixed: A issues
- Manual fixes applied: B issues
- Remaining issues: C
- Final verification command: <command>

Status: SUCCESS / PARTIAL / REQUIRES_MANUAL_REVIEW
```
